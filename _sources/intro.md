**Running the Notebooks**

Most of these quality assessments include Python code to produce data and figures which help answer the user question. This code is included primarily for transparency and traceability, but sections of it may also be directly applicable to your application and can be adapted or adjusted to your needs.

Most code in the Notebooks is self contained (but does make use of some [custom functions](https://github.com/bopen/c3s-eqc-automatic-quality-control/tree/main/c3s_eqc_automatic_quality_control) prepared by [BOpen](https://www.bopen.eu/)), while some quality assessments do rely on the outcomes and code of previous assessments.

Some of the analysis in the quality assessments is not compute or data intensive, and so the Notebooks (.ipynb files) can be downloaded and run on freely available cloud platforms, such as:==Add a similar list to the traning Notebooks, include WEKeO, also the new CDS toolbox?==
