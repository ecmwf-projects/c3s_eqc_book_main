# CLIMAAX Handbook

Introducing the __[CLIMAAX](https://www.climaax.eu)__ handbook - a dedicated guide for regions navigating the complexities of current and future climate risk. By providing a step-by-step framework and tools, the handbook aims to help regions understand what their climate risk is and inspire action.  The motto of the handbook is **'Standardised Flexibility'**. By blending the two concepts, we created a wealth of material while allowing you to shape it to your requirements.  

Our commitment goes beyond exploring new climate values. We aim to move from data to impacts across sectors, providing actionable guidance to stakeholders.
